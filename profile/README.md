<h1 align="center">UnfilteredBytes</h1>
<h2 align="center">The organization that stands against CIPA.</h2>

We are a small team of programmers with the intent to go against <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act">CIPA</a> for their restrictive laws and <a href=https://www.lightspeedsystems.com/>Lightspeed Systems</a> for their limiting web filter.
These laws and web filters are too aggressive, restrictive, and harsh. We believe that freedom should be applied to the internet too.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to have the ability to remove <a href=https://www.lightspeedsystems.com/>Lightspeed Systems</a> from school laptops, and grow free internet access.
